<strong>Purple</strong> is a color intermediate between blue and red.It is similar to violet, but unlike violet, which is a spectral color with its own wavelength on the visible spectrum of light, <strong>purple</strong> is a composite color made by combining red and blue.According to surveys in Europe and the U.S., <strong>purple</strong> is the color most often associated with royalty, magic, mystery, and piety.When combined with pink, it is associated with eroticism, femininity, and seduction.
<br>
<strong>Purple</strong> was the color worn by Roman magistrates; it became the imperial color worn by the rulers of the Byzantine Empire and the Holy Roman Empire, and later by Roman Catholic bishops. Similarly in Japan, the color is traditionally associated with the Emperor and aristocracy.The complementary color of <strong>purple</strong> is yellow.</p1>

<strong>Purple</strong> isn't a color either. The next time you see a rainbow, look carefully, and you'll find that <strong>purple</strong> is missing. Rainbows have all colors of the spectrum: red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet. But rainbows never include the color <strong>purple</strong>, because <strong>purple</strong> is not a true color.
